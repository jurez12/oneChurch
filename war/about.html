      <p class="sectionContent">When I was new to Bangalore city. I had faced problem finding a church where i can connect and grow in faith. My challenges where to find church of my denomination, church service should be in language i understand, church service time, Area church is located in etc. God gave me this idea to build a platform where people can find church and all the information related to church. Connect to the church by your presence or online watching sermons, reading publications, watch pictures and videos of events happening in your church,Be informed about the spiritual events happening in churches and in your city.</p>
